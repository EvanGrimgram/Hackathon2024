                <p>Women’s dress was characterized by long, flowing tunics and gowns made of wool or linen.
                    The layers included an under-tunic with long sleeves and an outer garment, often belted at the waist. Cloaks and
                    shawls provided warmth, and head coverings, like veils or wimples, were common, reflecting both social and
                    religious norms.

                <p>By the 13th century, dresses became more fitted with a gradual introduction of lacing to
                    define the waist. Women wore long gowns with fitted bodices and flared skirts. Surcoats, a type of sleeveless over-
                    garment, became fashionable, often worn over a fitted under-dress called a kirtle. Veils and coifs (close-fitting
                    caps) continued as popular headwear.

                    while the late 1800s saw the bustle, which added volume at the back of the dress. Corsets were common, defining
                    the waist. Fabrics were layered and heavily embellished with lace, ruffles, and bows.

                <p>In 2600, fashion has become a form of personal technology. Clothing is integrated with
                    advanced nanotechnology, enabling garments to change shape, color, and texture on
                    command. This adaptability allows for multifunctional outfits that can transition from casual to
                    formal with a simple voice command. The style is a mix of sleek, form-fitting designs and
                    flowing, dynamic fabrics that respond to the wearer’s movements. Fashion is not just about
                    aesthetics but also about enhancing human capabilities and interaction with the environment.

                <p>By 2800, Western fashion has evolved into a symbiotic relationship between humans and their
                    attire. Clothing is grown from organic materials that are genetically engineered to provide
                    various benefits, such as enhanced strength, protection, and even healing properties. The
                    designs are inspired by nature, with flowing, organic shapes and colors that mimic the natural
                    world. Fashion is deeply personalized, with each garment being a living entity that adapts to the
                    wearer’s lifestyle and preferences.

                <p>In the year 3000, fashion transcends the physical realm entirely. People wear holographic
                    garments that can be customized in real-time, offering limitless possibilities for self-expression.
                    These holograms are controlled by neural interfaces, allowing for instantaneous changes in
                    style, color, and form. The aesthetic is a blend of ethereal, otherworldly designs and futuristic
                    minimalism, reflecting a society that has moved beyond traditional material constraints. Fashion
                    in 3000 is a dynamic, ever-changing art form that seamlessly integrates with the digital and
                    physical worlds.
