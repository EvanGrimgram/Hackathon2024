                <p>Women’s dress was characterized by long, flowing tunics and gowns made of wool or linen.
                    The layers included an under-tunic with long sleeves and an outer garment, often belted at the waist. Cloaks and
                    shawls provided warmth, and head coverings, like veils or wimples, were common, reflecting both social and
                    religious norms.

                <p>By the 13th century, dresses became more fitted with a gradual introduction of lacing to
                    define the waist. Women wore long gowns with fitted bodices and flared skirts. Surcoats, a type of sleeveless over-
                    garment, became fashionable, often worn over a fitted under-dress called a kirtle. Veils and coifs (close-fitting
                    caps) continued as popular headwear.

                    necklines, and fuller skirts. The “houppelande” (a robe-like dress with large, voluminous sleeves) gained popularity,
                    as did the hennin, a tall, conical headdress. Fabrics became richer, with silks, velvets, and embroidery, especially
                    among the wealthy.

                <p>This century saw the introduction of more dramatic silhouettes and detailed embellishments.
                    Dresses had a structured bodice, often with a stomacher (a decorated panel over the front), wide skirts, and lace
                    collars. Sleeves were puffed or slashed, and the “petticoat” style with layers under the skirt became more
                    widespread. Hairstyles became elaborate with curls, and the “fontange” (a tall, lace headdress) emerged later in
                    the century.

                <p>Fashion varied significantly, with early 1800s women embracing high-waisted, flowing
                    “Empire” dresses inspired by classical antiquity. By the mid-century, crinolines and hoop skirts created wider skirts,
                    while the late 1800s saw the bustle, which added volume at the back of the dress. Corsets were common, defining
                    the waist. Fabrics were layered and heavily embellished with lace, ruffles, and bows.

                    monitor the wearer’s health and adjust temperature and fit for optimal comfort. The aesthetic
